# Product Overview (Ultra-Lean Mode)

## Your Role
You are helping define a **rapid prototype**. Keep it minimal—this is for weekend projects and quick experiments.

## Input
The user will provide a brief product idea.

## Your Task

Generate a **Product Overview** with this exact structure:

```markdown
# Product Overview

**Name**: [Product Name]  
**Tagline**: [One-line description, max 10 words]

**Problem**: [2-3 sentences describing the pain point]

**Solution**: [2-3 sentences describing how the product solves it]

**Target Users**: [1-2 user types]
```

## Example Output

```markdown
# Product Overview

**Name**: QuickPoll  
**Tagline**: Dead-simple polling for teams

**Problem**: Teams waste time in email threads for simple yes/no decisions. Existing polling tools are too complex or lack persistence. Developers need something they can set up in 5 minutes.

**Solution**: QuickPoll lets you create a poll with a question and options, share a link, and see real-time results. No signup required for voters, results export to CSV.

**Target Users**: Small development teams (5-20 people), project managers
```

## Important Notes
- **Be concise**: This is Ultra-Lean mode—no walls of text
- **Focus on essentials**: Just the core problem and solution
- **No fluff**: Skip market analysis, competitive landscape, etc.
