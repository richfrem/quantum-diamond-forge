==========START EXAMPLE============

# Product Overview

**Name**: QuickPoll  
**Tagline**: Dead-simple polling for teams

**Problem**: Teams waste time in email threads for simple yes/no decisions. Existing polling tools are too complex or lack persistence. Developers need something they can set up in 5 minutes.

**Solution**: QuickPoll lets you create a poll with a question and options, share a link, and see real-time results. No signup required for voters, results export to CSV.

**Target Users**: Small development teams (5-20 people), project managers
