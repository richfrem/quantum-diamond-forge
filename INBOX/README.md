# Inbox

**Drop Zone for AI Processing**

Place any drafts, notes, or external documents here that you want the Antigravity Agent to review, refactor, or integrate into the project.

**Workflow:**
1. Drag files here.
2. Tell the Agent: "Check the Inbox."
3. The Agent will process them and move them to their permanent home (e.g., `docs/`, `TASKS/`).
