# Antigravity Git Safety Rules

**Version:** 1.2  
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-23  
**Purpose:** Prevent data loss, unnecessary branching, and workflow confusion in AI-assisted development.

---

This file defines strict rules for Git operations to prevent data loss, unnecessary branching, and workflow confusion. It is designed for use with AI coding assistants like **Antigravity**, **Cursor**, **GitHub Copilot**, and **VS Code extensions**.

## 1. Branch Management
*   **NO Panic Branching:** Never create a new branch just because a push to `main` or another branch failed.
*   **Single Source of Truth:** Always use the existing feature branch for the current task. Do not create `feature/foo-complete` or `feature/foo-final`.
*   **Naming Convention:** Use descriptive names like `feature/task-description` or `fix/bug-id`. Avoid vague names like `temp`, `backup`, or `test`.
*   **Clean Up (Both Local and Remote):** Delete feature branches only AFTER they have been successfully merged and verified:
    ```bash
    # Verify the branch is merged first
    git branch --merged | grep feature/branch-name
    
    # Fallback for squash merges: Check commit history or GitHub UI
    # git log origin/main | grep <commit-hash-from-branch>
    
    # Then delete
    git branch -D feature/branch-name           # Delete local
    git push origin --delete feature/branch-name # Delete remote
    ```

## 2. Destructive Commands
*   **NO Reckless Resets:** Never run `git reset --hard` unless:
    1.  You have explicitly verified that all valuable changes are pushed to a remote branch.
    2.  You have user permission.
    3.  If uncommitted work exists, run `git stash` first and inform the user.
    
    **Bad Example:**
    ```bash
    git reset --hard origin/main  # ❌ Destroys uncommitted work
    ```
    
    **Good Example:**
    ```bash
    git stash                     # ✅ Save uncommitted work
    git reset --hard origin/main  # ✅ Reset with user permission
    git stash pop                 # ✅ Restore work (with user OK)
    ```

*   **NO Force Pushes:** Do not use `git push --force` or `-f` on shared branches.

*   **NO Rebase on Shared Branches:** Avoid `git rebase` on branches that others are working on (e.g., `main`, `dev`). 
    
    **When Rebase IS Okay:**
    - Solo feature branches only
    - After `git fetch origin` to sync with remote
    - After reviewing potential conflicts
    
    **Example:**
    ```bash
    git fetch origin              # ✅ Sync first
    git rebase origin/main        # ✅ Only on solo feature branch
    ```
    
    **Interactive Rebase:**
    - If using `git rebase -i`, always review and test changes before pushing

## 3. Workflow
*   **Protected Branches:** Assume `main` and `master` are protected. Always use a Pull Request workflow.
*   **Status Checks:** Always run `git status` before and after complex operations to confirm state.
*   **Context Awareness:** Before running a command, verify:
    *   Which branch am I on?
    *   What is the state of the remote? Run `git fetch origin` to update remote state before decisions.
    *   Will this command destroy uncommitted or unpushed work?
    *   Run `git diff --cached` (staged) and `git diff` (unstaged) to review changes before committing.
*   **PR Creation:** If pushing to `main` fails due to protections, create a PR:
    ```bash
    # Option 1: GitHub CLI (if installed)
    gh pr create --draft --title "WIP: Feature Name"
    
    # Option 2: Web UI
    # Navigate to GitHub and create PR manually
    ```

## 4. Error Handling
*   **STOP and Analyze:** If a Git command fails, **STOP**. Do not blindly try a different command or create a new branch.
*   **Error Reporting Template:** When reporting errors to the user, use this format:
    ```
    ❌ Git Error Detected
    Error Message: [exact error output]
    Current Branch: [branch name]
    Git Status: [summary of git status]
    Suggested Safe Next Steps:
      1. [Option 1]
      2. [Option 2]
      3. [Option 3]
    ```
*   **Common Recoveries:**
    - **For merge conflicts:** Suggest `git mergetool` or abort with `git merge --abort`
    - **For rebase conflicts:** Suggest `git rebase --abort` or resolve and `git rebase --continue`
    - **For detached HEAD:** Suggest `git checkout <branch-name>` to return to a branch
*   **Ask for Guidance:** If the path forward involves potential data loss, ask the user for explicit permission.

## 5. Sequential Workflow (The "Finish It" Rule)
*   **One Thing at a Time:** Do NOT start new work, create new files, or push new commits if a Pull Request is active and pending merge.
*   **Complete the Cycle:** The workflow is: `Feature Branch` -> `PR` -> `Merge` -> `Cleanup (Delete Local AND Remote Branch)` -> `Pull Main`. Only THEN can new work begin.
*   **Post-Merge Sync:** Immediately after a PR is merged, run:
    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git pull origin main
    ```
*   **No "Ride-Along" Commits:** Do not add unrelated changes (like documentation updates or rule files) to a feature branch that is already under review or ready for PR. Create a new branch *after* the current one is merged.
    *   **Exception:** Urgent hotfixes may bypass this rule but MUST use a separate `hotfix/` branch and be merged via PR with expedited review. Follow the full cycle post-merge.

## 6. Pre-Command Checklist
Before executing any Git command that modifies history or state, **output this checklist** and verify each item:

```
🔍 Pre-Command Checklist:
[ ] I am on the correct branch (run: git branch --show-current)
[ ] I have reviewed uncommitted changes (run: git status, git diff)
[ ] All valuable work is committed or stashed
[ ] I have user permission for destructive operations
[ ] I understand the consequences of this command
```

**For AI Assistants:** Mark each checkbox as you verify, then proceed only if all checks pass.

## 7. Integration Notes

### For Antigravity
Reference this file in your agent prompts:
```
"Strictly adhere to .agent/git_safety_rules.md. Before any Git action, run the Pre-Command Checklist and confirm compliance."
```

### For Cursor
1. **Option 1:** Add this file's content directly to Cursor's **Rules for AI** editor (Settings → Cursor Settings → Rules for AI)
2. **Option 2:** Save as `.cursorrules` in your project root and reference it in prompts
3. Use GitLens extension for visual verification of branch state

### For VS Code / Copilot
1. Save this file as `.agent/git_safety_rules.md` or `.vscode/git_safety_rules.md`
2. In Copilot settings, add a workspace prompt:
   ```
   "Follow the Git safety rules in .agent/git_safety_rules.md before executing any Git commands."
   ```
3. Use extensions like **GitLens** for visual verification of branch state

### Testing
Simulate failure scenarios in a dummy repo to verify adherence:
- Force a push failure to `main` and confirm no panic branching occurs
- Trigger a merge conflict and verify proper error reporting
- Test reset scenarios to ensure stash is used

### Enforcement Tools
- **Git Hooks:** Use Husky to automate pre-commit/pre-push checks
- **Security:** Pair with GitGuardian for secret scanning
- **Monitoring:** Review LLM outputs regularly; if rules are violated, add negative examples to this file

## 8. Security Considerations
*   **Secret Scanning:** Before committing, scan for secrets:
    ```bash
    git secrets --scan  # Or use GitGuardian
    ```
*   **AI Security Integration:** When suggesting code edits, incorporate security checks from established rulesets (e.g., OWASP, SecureCodeWarrior)
*   **Prompt Addition for AI:** "Before committing code changes, verify no hardcoded secrets, API keys, or credentials are present."

**Remember:** These rules exist to protect your work. When in doubt, ask the user before proceeding.

**Violations?** Update this file with the incident as a negative example to improve AI adherence over time.
